[yoast-breadcrumbs]<p>Sometimes its hard to share calendars and get connected. This tool will let you select dates in my calendar for events and set them up in Microsoft Teams so that I am able to manage Breakout Rooms, and otherwise make it an awesome experience.</p><p><strong>When booking do not add more people that you can get to agree! Everyone that is added to the meeting must pick a time before it will be agreed!Â </strong>Once you have an invitation please feel free to share it internally.</p>
