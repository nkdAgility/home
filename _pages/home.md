						He explains things clearly and shows how any team can make small improvements to improve how they work.

						I can strongly recommend Martin whether your needs are broadly across the DevOps spectrum or deeply into the most complex enterprise wide Azure DevOps migrations.

						 Martin did a fantastic job of explaining the concepts and matching them with relevant examples from our industry.

						As a leader within an organization that is about to begin an agile evolution, I'll be honest - I was sceptical that our group would get much out of this training session; however, I was proven wrong after the first day.

								<cite>Lisa ReinerIT Agile Leadership, Jack Links</cite>			
						He helped provide guidance to my team and for the organization I work for. Martin took to the time to explore the many scenarios that one might encounter when looking to structure an approach to adopt Scrum as your primary software delivery solution.

						Martin's depth and breadth of knowledge and experience of the world of Agile/DevOps is incredible. He will switch between hands on development to advanced consulting or training on process, practices and tools to help you in your own DevOps journey.
