<h1> Professional Communities from naked Agility!</h1>
We are moving away from Mailing lists towards active community interaction. As such we have started "Previews" for our two communities:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Professional Scrum Community (Preview)</strong> - This community is for anyone intersted in discussing Scrum, Kanban, &amp; Agile. This community is made up of many folks that have been through Scrumorg Professional Scrum training with Martin Hinshelwood, as well as those that are intersted in discussing.

 	<li><strong>Professional DevOps Community (Preview)</strong> - This community is for anyone intersted in discussing DevOps Practices, Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server, and any other DevOps topics that you can think of..
