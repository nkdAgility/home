<!-- /wp:list --><p>For most of our training, the above items are enough for you to get a lot out of the training. Please consider that we have two desired outcomes. The first is to teach you what Scrum, Kanban, or DevOps is, how it should be used, and why. The second is to help you implement Scrum, Kanban, &amp; DevOps inside of your organisation. Our trainers will be dogmatic on the rules, but pragmatic on the implementation. </p>		
			<h2>4 - Prepare your Workstation</h2>		
		<p>Running &amp; Participating in Live Virtual Classes is hard work. We do a lot to prepare our workstations and create the Murals and setup Teams. Its really important to us that you don't have a bad experience. These are the thing that we have found help!</p>

<li>For both Mac and Windows, it is recommended to install the app.</li>
<li>If you are joining from your phone, then please use the app from your store.</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams is totally OK with you joining from more than one device with the same login if that is how you get multiple screens. When you connect your second device make sure that you &#8220;join with audio off&#8221; so you don&#8217;t get feedback.</li>
