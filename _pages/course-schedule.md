<h1>Course Schedule for DevOps, ALM, Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server, and Professional Scrum</h1>
You can find a <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/training/">list of available courses </a>on our training page. Here we will list the upcoming and scheduled courses as well as any past classes that we have run. We rarely do public classes but if you can get enough people together we would be happy to run either a public, or a private class.
<h2>Scheduled and Upcoming Classes</h2>
Many of our classes are run privately for a specific customer. We try to list all of the courses that we have scheduled.
