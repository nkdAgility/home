<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have gathered content below which we suggest you utilize when preparing for the PSU I. These are suggested resources, and you may find resources not mentioned on this page helpful, along with the application of your own experience using Scrum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Take the <a href="/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-training/">Professional Scrum™ with User Experience</a> training course.</li>
<li>Become very familiar with the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Scrum Guide</a>.
<ul>
<li>Take the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrum Open</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Product </a>Owner Open assessments to get a baseline of your knowledge and take them again until you are comfortable with the content. The Open assessments are a learning tool, and thus feedback is provided during the test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A study from the Scrum Master journey with the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/pathway/scrum-master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrum Master Learning Path</a>.</li>
<li>Know which agile practices you may have seen or used that are NOT part of the Scrum framework. Teams need to pull in the complementary practices that fit their ever-changing needs, but it is important to know what is and is not required by Scrum.</li>
