		<p>All of our workshops and training can be delivered in-person or as Live Virtual Classrooms. We recommend that you deliver training in the same way that you work. We have also noted a 6% bump in pass rates for classes with assessments when taken virtually.</p>

<p>For Live Virtual workshops &amp; training we offer an additional 30 minutes per student that takes the assessment within 14 days to help them with their future learning, as well as 25% of the class time as additional consulting, coaching, and training sessions to be used within 6 months of the class.</p>

			<h4>OUR TEAM</h4>		
		<p>We believe that every company deserves high quality software delivered on a regular cadence that meets its customers needs. Our goal is to help you reduce your cycle time, improve your time to market, and minimise any organisational friction in achieving your goals.</p>		
		<p>naked Agility Limited is a professional company that offers training, coaching, mentoring, and facilitation to help people and teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve.</p>
<p>We recognise the positive impact that a happy AND motivated workforce, that has purpose, has on client experience. We help change mindsets towards a people-first culture where everyone encourages others to learn and grow. The resulting divergent thinking leads to many different ideas and opportunities for the success of the organisation.</p>
