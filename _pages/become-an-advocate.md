			<h2>OUR TEAM</h2>		
		<p>We believe that every company deserves high quality software delivered on a regular cadence that meets its customers needs. Our goal is to help you reduce your cycle time, improve your time to market, and minimise any organisational friction in achieving your goals.</p>		
		<p>naked Agility Limited is a professional company that offers training, coaching, mentoring, and facilitation to help people and teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve.</p>
<p>We recognise the positive impact that a happy AND motivated workforce, that has purpose, has on client experience.
