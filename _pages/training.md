			<h1>Agile &amp; DevOps Training</h1>		
		<p>Our Professional Scrum and DevOps trainers help teams and leaders catalyse a mindset shift towards modern management and engineering practices.</p><p>While training can't be used to enact change on its own, it can be used to plant the seeds that you need to grow an agile mindset within your organisation. </p>

						Great class and enjoyed the conversations. The team really took to the personal situational talk and the trainers were able to not only keep us engaged but make it so much fun.

			<h2>Our Training Approach</h2>		
		<p>Our trainers are all accredited from Scrum.org, ProKanban.org, or Accentient and have the expertise backing it through long experience in delivering valuable outcomes to customers.</p><p>The trainer will facilitate a team-based collaborative learning experience that is designed by some of the best minds in Agility &amp; DevOps to plant the seeds of an agile mindset and tackle some of the hard questions.</p><p>The courseware is designed to elicit conversations between participants on the hard truths of moving from traditional management practices to empirical management practices. Special attention is paid to the known and common misunderstandings of agility as well as the ideas that are usually swept away under the pressures of "how we do things here".</p><p>To learn and adapt together it is important that all relevant levels of the organisation participate in the same training, as the realisations are profound. All organisations are different in terms of which ways of working are effective for them. Our training will help your people explore those options in an environment within which it is safe to fail.</p>Corporate training rates staring from:
