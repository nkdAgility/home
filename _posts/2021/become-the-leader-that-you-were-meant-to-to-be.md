<p>Leadership is not about control, but about inspiring those around you. </p>

<h2 id="h-managers-transition-to-leaders">Managers transition to Leaders</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As organisations move towards modern management practices there will be less of a need for Managers. However that does not mean that those same people are not needed! Their role is shifting from managing people, to managing effectiveness and leading people!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a traditional organization, people report to people up the chain of hierarchy.&nbsp; No matter how important we say our customers are to our company, people (even managers) RESPOND to Who is Above Them.&nbsp;We need to change this and upend the story. CxO's become responsible for clearing obstacles for the Leaders in the organisation to do the same for their teams. </p>

<h2 id="h-the-scrum-master-is-a-leadership-role">The Scrum Master is a Leadership Role</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a belief that the Scrum Master is the Scrum Team's manager or maybe a Scribe, or even and admin. The Scrum master is not not Report Driven or interested in Resource Utilisation! <strong>They are a leader who provides services to the Scrum Team, the Product Owner, &amp; the Organisation.</strong></p>
