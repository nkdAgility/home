<p>In the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/">The Evidence-Based Management Guide</a> we talk about the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/product-goal-is-an-intermediate-strategic-goal/">Intermediate Strategic Goal</a> and I likened that to the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product Goal</a> in the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide">2020 Scrum Guide</a>. If we also think of each Sprint as a tactical move towards fulfilling that <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product Goal</a> then the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a> becomes an Intermediate Tactical Goal that moves us towards our current Intermediate Strategic Goal.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal is a Commitment for the Sprint Backlog</a> and should never be "complete those 10 things" but instead should to describe the Why of the Sprint. </p>

<p>Just as the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product Goal</a> provides the current Strategic direction so the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a> is the smaller step, the implementation step towards it. The <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> is accountable for maximizing the value delivered and should be thinking hard, with the help of the Developers, on what the next tactical outcome they want to try and achieve is.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a> should be high level and I would recommend that using a Lean Canvas to help identify not only the business objective but the behaviour that the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> is trying to create in users or other systems. While I favour the Lean UX Canvas, which we teach in the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-training/">Professional Scrum with UX</a>, there are many valid options out there to use as a complementary practice in this space.</p>

<p>At a minimum, I would expect a <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> to have a hypothesis. A hypothesis is like an assumption, but also with a measure/metric that tells you if you have validated that assumption. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owners</a> are accountable for maximising value and should be looking to not just build features that customers need now, but predict or drive which features that they need now. </p>

<h3 id="h-a-good-product-owner-will-build-features-now-that-your-customers-need-now">A good Product Owner will build features now that your customers need now.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We should always be working to engage with our users; users don't engage when you build a feature that they will need in 6 months. Instead, we should focus on what will solve an immediate business problem for our users. This will engage them in the process and elicit much more excellent feedback from them. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trick for any <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> is to figure out where the market is going and build features that drive it, rather than just following it. Having a vision and entrepreneurially iterating towards that vision empirically with many small hypotheses is key to unlocking this level up of Product Ownership.</p>
