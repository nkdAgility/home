<p>One of my customers is asking me about the accountabilities of a Product Owner and how they break down. While I had seen many things around the Scrum Master for my post on <a href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/hiring-a-professional-scrum-master/">Hiring a Professional Scrum Master</a>, this was a little bit more of a discovery session, which is why I asked some of my trusted colleagues at Scrum.org to help out.</p>

<p>This represents my best efforts to pull together a specification of the Product Owner accountability from the Scrum Guide, agile practitioners, and a little bit of experience.</p>

<p>In general, I do not see companies hiring for a <a href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/product-owners/">Product Owner</a> but instead promoting from within. Maximizing the value in the product requires intimate knowledge of the business context, the existing state of the market, and the things that make your business distinctive. They need not only these understandings but also the ability to communicate effectively with Developers and Stakeholders.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My take on the above…I am seeing the opposite.&nbsp; I’m seeing more companies valuing Product Ownership as a skill and going outside for it.&nbsp; I think this is a positive trend and will probably have the benefit of bringing an outside perspective to a company which may be exactly what a product needs.</p><p><strong>Data:</strong> LinkedIn has 12,894 jobs for “Product Owner just in the US right now and 25,520 for “Product Manager”.&nbsp; Didn’t look at global numbers.</p><cite>- <a href="https://www.scrum.org/jim-sammons">Jim Sammons | Scrum.org</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>I do mention certifications, both from Scrum.org and Scrum Alliance, and please be aware that certification is not an indication of competence but may be used as a simple bar to reduce the load on interviews and assert a minimum level of knowledge, at $200 for a PSPO I assessment and $250 PSPO II assessment. With a reputation in the industry of not being totally easy, these are a no brainer for any aspiring or experienced Product Owner. There are more than 100k people with PSPO I and 2k people with PSPO II at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The assessments can be used to inspect and adapt your own knowledge and there is even a free <a href="https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Product Owner Open</a> assessment.</p>

<p>The key point in the above is the delegation point; we are not thinking that a single Product Owner is able to conduct all of the above on a Programme of this size – and we obviously have other members of the Hiscox team, and Cognizant Business Analysts to share the load… but accountability remains with the Product Owner.</p>
