<p>This is the second in our complimentary workshop series where we explore some of the basics around agility, Scrum, and Kanban. The Skill level here is a beginner and I will be facilitating it with Liberating Structures. It will be delivered in Microsoft Teams and Mural as a live interactive experience as well as being streamed live for those that just want to watch!</p>
