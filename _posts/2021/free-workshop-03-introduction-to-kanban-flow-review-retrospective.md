<!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"230000"}} -->
<p>This workshop was delivered on 2nd September 2021 and focused on introducing the core concepts of Kanban &amp; Flow. I used a combination of Liberating Structures, Microsoft Teams, and Mural to deliver an interactive session. This session did not go well and timing and explanations, perhaps with other considerations resulted in a haphazard and inconsistent session from my perspective.</p>

<p>That said, much of the feedback was positive... so there is that!</p>

<p>I attempted to introduce the core concepts of Kanban and Lean in a 90-minute session and it quickly got away from me and we really were only able to focus on Batch Size.</p>

<p>For this third session, my goal was to experiment with some new techniques for delivering Flow &amp; Kanban in just 60-90 minutes. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"230000"}} -->
<p>We also experimented with using my Course Ticket system for taking registrations. We had over 90 people registered and about 30 people turned up. This time I made sure that all of the attendees had explicit access to the join link. I did not see any complaints about not being able to join.</p>

<p>For the delivery, we used a combination of Microsoft Teams and Mural for the delivery and things went relatively well:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Microsoft Teams Webcast</strong> - Very late in the game I ditched this in favour of just emaileing everyone a link. This has resulted in a technology change.</li><li><strong>Microsoft Teams Breakout Rooms</strong> -  Again the locking out of the meeting 10 minutes in results in much better participation and less breakages. We did has quite a few people leave early, however this was content and delivery realted and not technology.</li><li><strong>Mural </strong>- No Additional Feedback.</li></ul>

<p>For the recording and live stream we used a combination of NDI &amp; OBS:</p>

<p>I believe that we met the goal and the feedback was very positive ( Other than those that could not get in). I was very happy with all of the technology used.</p>

<p>Negative feedback is mostly around timing and participant involvement. Getting more of the people involved is important, however, it's hard to involve folks that don't have their camera on when others do!</p>
