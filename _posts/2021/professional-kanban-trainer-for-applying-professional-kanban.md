<p>The <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Scrum Guide</a> only contains the minimum necessary to create an e<strong>mpirical process control system for managing risk</strong>. The new <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide/">Kanban Guide</a> reflects the minimum that you need to do to create a <strong>strategy for optimizing the flow of value through a visual, pull-based system</strong>.</p>

<p>With the integration of the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide-for-scrum-teams/">Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams</a> into the world of Scrum.org, I had been waiting for Daniel Vacanti and co to release more around Professional Kanban. It was my very first thought when I attended the beta teach of the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-kanban-training-with-certification/">Professional Scrum with Kanban</a> training in Burlington, Masatusis in January 2018.</p>

<p><strong> I did not have to wait long. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel has founded <a href="https://prokanban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProKanban.org</a> and collaborated to create, under creative commons, the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide/">Kanban Guide</a>. This guide is freely available on <a href="https://kanbanguides.org/">kanbanguides.org</a>  and starts a new era of openness and respect between the Scrum &amp; Kanban communities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of this, I have become the 20th <a href="https://prokanban.org/trainers/">Professional Kanban Trainer</a> at ProKanban.org and I am now able to teach the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/">Applying Professional Kanban training</a> class.</p>

<p>These two are very different classes that are founded on the same core theory, principals, and practices to create the same outcome. I love teaching Scrum &amp; Kanban together, and I am really looking forward to teaching Kanban on its own!</p>

<p>You don't have to take the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-kanban-training-with-certification/">Applying Professional Kanban</a> training to take the assessment. They are decoupled and they have an excellent <a href="https://prokanban.org/kanban-learning-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanban Learning Resources</a> page that will help you get started. I have forked that resource and will be adding some of my own items on the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/study-guide-for-professional-kanban/">Study Guide for Professional Kanban</a>.</p>
