<p>I have been working on perfecting my techniques by incorporating Liberating Structures, Training from the Back of the Room, and Organization and Relationship Systems Coaching into my deliveries. I have found, along with many other trainers, that live-virtual delivery of classes can be more powerful, and more engaging. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can do this by leveraging the additional time format, timezones, and techniques that are available in the virtual world. I for one have found it better all around! I have been able to engage with more customers and spend more time with them all. It has moved my training business from a one-and-done model to a longer-term partnership with my customers. This is primarily due to my ability to optimise my time as I am no longer travelling 300 days a year.</p>

<p>Not everyone is convinced that Live Virtual Classrooms can be delivered as well, if not better, than in-person classes. After 18 months of only doing live virtual classrooms, I feel that I create a significantly better experience for students with better knowledge retention than I was able to do in person. As some areas open back up it will be interesting how I can translate the new learnings to the old model.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To demonstrate value to those that are unsure I have been running some free live virtual workshops that have been live-streamed and been getting pretty good participation. Here are the recordings and murals for the most recent workshops:</p>
