<!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"230000"}} -->
<p>This workshop was delivered on 19th August 2021 and focused on introducing the core concepts of Scrum &amp; Empiricism. I used a combination of Liberating Structures, Microsoft Teams, and Mural to deliver an interactive session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"230000"}} -->
<p>This workshop will introduce the Scrum Framework, dispel myths, and bring the core purpose of the Scrum Events, rather than the mechanics to the forefront.</p>

<p>For this second session, my goal was to build on the first session and seek to improve the use of technology. </p>

<p>We received nearly 102 registered participants and around 30 turned up for the session. While we got more registered we had fewer attend. It looks like some folks were unable to find the link to join in person. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"230000"}} -->
<p>Commitment: I have sent some feedback to the Teams Team and plan on sending out the link manually next time to everyone that registered just before the session.</p>

<p>For the delivery, we used a combination of Microsoft Teams and Mural for the delivery and things went relatively well:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Microsoft Teams Webcast</strong> - Registrations were taken therough a new Microsoft Teams registration portal and this was mostly sucessfull<ul><li>Feedback: Some people did not get thier emails, even after checking logs and spam. This hsould be easy ro rectfiy by resending emails before the session and having it display the link when folks click submit.</li><li>Feedback: For some reason the system lets folks register twise rather than just resending or displaying the link.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Microsoft Teams Breakout Rooms</strong> - No bumps this time as I locked the meeting after 10 minutes. Not having folks pop in during breakout creation fixed the issues. For the 2 people that left early it was easy to work around their ghost.</li><li><strong>Mural </strong>- No Additional Feedback.</li></ul>

<p>For the recording and live stream we used a combination of NDI &amp; OBS:</p>

<p>I believe that we met the goal and the feedback was very positive ( Other than those that could not get in). I was very happy with all of the technology used.</p>

There were many misconceptions that seam to be accepted as part of Scrum. Dispelling myths could be a whole workshop!</li></ul>

<p>In this session, I was experimenting with quite a few things to see if it would work. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Locking the Meeting</strong> - In order to prevent disruption in the interactive workshop I locked the meeting after the Icebreaker. This was awesome and really helped reduce disractions, increase focus, and improve the technical isuses from before.</li><li><strong>30+ people in an Interactive Session</strong> - Much hapyier this time. We started with about 30 people and a few dropped of during the session. </li></ul>
