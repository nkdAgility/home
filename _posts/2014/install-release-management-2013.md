<p>Just recently I have been doing a lot of work in Release Management 2013 and noticed the lack of documentation. I have done a number of installs and documented them is posts like <a title="Installing Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2013" href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/installing-release-management-client-visual-studio-2013/">Installing Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2013</a> and <a title="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/installing-release-management-server-tfs-2013/" href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/installing-release-management-server-tfs-2013/">Installing Release Management Server for TFS 2013</a> however there is always things that donâ€™t quite join up. I often have to head off an fix problems or get support as part of my posts an while I almost always blog those issues there is no joined up experience.</p>
