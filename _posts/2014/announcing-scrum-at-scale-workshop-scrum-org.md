<p class="lead">If you are scaling agility in the enterprise through scrum then you will understand when I say that this can be a very difficult problem. And it's mostly about people and about culture and the <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/training/courses/scrum-at-scale-workshop/">Scrum at Scale Workshop</a> can help you.</p>
<p>Scrum.org have long since recognised that many efforts to implement agile in the enterprise have failed or not resulted in the benefits that people were hoping for. This is almost universally due to a lack of commitment to change. And this in turn is the result of your current organisational culture that is finely tuned to produce the current situation. To move forward you need to change that culture.</p>
<p>Scrum.org first introduced a Scrum at Scale model called <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/experts/evidence-based-management-for-software-organisations/">Evidence-based Management for Software Organisations</a>. This was an embodiment of the empirical techniques inherent in Scrum as applied to organisational change and especially in enterprise. This gave you a way to incrementally change your organisation for the better while maintaining a sense of urgency. As part of this framework for organisational change a tool to help you monitor that change was also introduced. This calculated an <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/evidence-based-management-gathering-metrics/">Agility Index from key metrics</a> that gave you an idea of where you currently are and allowed you to continuously measure and improve.</p>
<p>Knowing where you are and how much you have improved is good, and we also need to know where to go. Agility Index also included a <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/metrics-that-matter-with-evidence-based-management/">practices assessment that assessed the maturity of your organisation</a>. This assessment is based on what we know works within organisations and is graded as all practices, or depth of practice, do not provide value of all companies.</p>
<p>These concepts are not new and <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/what-my-father-taught-me-about-agility-path-34-years-before-it-was-invented/">my father was using these techniques in business 30 years ago</a>. While not new, the application of these techniques to adapt your organisation based on metrics and best practices are not easy to implement.</p>
<p>This is why Scrum.org (Ken Schwaber) &amp; Scrum Inc. (Jeff Sutherland) have joined forces to provide the <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/training/courses/scrum-at-scale-workshop/">Scrum at Scale Workshop</a> for those people who are responsible for change within their organisation. If you are leading the change within your organisation you could be a development manager, or coach, or just the someone with a vested interest in success.</p>

While the Professional Scrum Foundations is the first thing you need to level set your teams before you commence with a Scrum implementation, the <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/training/courses/scrum-at-scale-workshop/">Scrum at Scale Workshop</a> is what you need to get started at the organisational level.</p>
<p>The first two ever public courses for Scrum at Scale is available: <a href="https://www.scrum.org/courses/scrum-at-scale" target="_blank">https://www.scrum.org/courses/scrum-at-scale</a></p>
