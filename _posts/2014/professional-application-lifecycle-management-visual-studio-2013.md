<p class="lead">About 6 months ago I was approached by Mickey to help him on the third edition of Professional Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2013. I jumped at the chance, only to be in dismay at the amount of work, and now relieved that it is all over. I could not believe the amount of work that goes into producing a book of the calibre and while fun, deadlines were not...&nbsp;</p>

It will be available on 29th April 2014 in the UK on <a href="http://nkdalm.net/ProALMwithVS13uk">Amazon.co.uk</a> who is currently taking pre-orders. This was a monumental effort and I would not have been able to without the support from Brian and Mickey who had both been through the trauma of writing a book before.</p>
<p>It really was hard going mapping the new features in the 2013 version of the product to the previous editions as well as making sure that the recommendations stayed current. For example when the book was originally written the MSF for Agile Software Development process template was the default out of the box and there really was no implementation of Scrum in TFS. You know my <a href="http://nakedalmweb.wpengine.com/agile-vs-scrum-process-templates-team-foundation-server/">feelings on the MSF for Agile Software Development template</a>. This changed with Visual Studio 2012 when the Visual Studio Scrum template became the default out of the box and I felt that it was high time that the foremost ALM book for Visual Studio reflected reality a little better and had a little more agility to it.</p>
